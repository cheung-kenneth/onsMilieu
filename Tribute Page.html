Its name derives from the recognition of the umbrella as a symbol of defiance and resistance against the Hong Kong Police, and the united grass-roots objection to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of 31 August.</p>

                                    Terms are set for the 2017 Elections from the National People's Congress Standing Committee.<br><br>
                                    Because candidates whom Beijing deems unsuitable would not be nominated, pro-democracy advocates view the decision as a betrayal of the principle of "one person, one vote."</p>
                                   
                                    
                                    <p><strong>September 22, 2014</strong><br>
                                    Two student movements, the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) and “Scholarism” begin a class boycott.<br><br>
                                    Their demands include: universal suffrage, the resignation of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the withdrawal of the NPC Standing Committee’s decision, and the submission of a new electoral reform plan.</p>

                                    <p><strong>September 26, 2014</strong><br>
                                    The police arrest Joshua Wong, a veteran activist at the age of only 17 and the organizer of Scholarism, but release him two days later on Sept. 28.</p>

                                    <p><strong>September 27, 2014</strong><br>
                                    Protesters march to central government offices. Police use pepper spray against the protesters. Several protesters are injured and more are detained.</p><br>
